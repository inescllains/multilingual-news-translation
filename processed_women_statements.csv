Statements at meetings of different groups of women -,1402/10,"/06 Card title: Equality of human values in men and women Keyword(s): Islamic model of woman, third model of woman, woman, woman in Islam Type(s): Quran Card text: In some cases, Islam completely ignores gender; the issue is not a man-woman issue, it is a question of human dignity: And indeed, We have honored the children of Adam; (1) The issue of gender is not raised here. Human values are the same in men and women, and in the value relationship between them and the male gender, gender is absolutely irrelevant: “And the believing men and the believing women are the guardians of one another, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong” (2) to the end; “Indeed, the believing men and the believing women, the believing men and the believing women, the believing men and the believing women, the believing women and the believing men and the believing women” (3) to the end of the verse of Surah Al-Ahzab. All of these are equal before God Almighty in the levels of spiritual ascension; that is, neither one is preferred over him, nor is he preferred over the other; both have been placed on this path with similar talents, and it depends on their efforts; they are women whom no man can reach. Therefore, gender is not an issue. 1) Surah Al-Isra, verse 70 And We have certainly honored the children of Adam, and We have carried them on land and sea, and We have provided them with good things, and We have preferred them over many of those We have created. 2) Surah Mubaraka Al-Tawba verse 71 And the believers and the believers are saints to each other. Allah and His Messenger ۚ وليك سيرحمهوم الله ُ ۗ God is dear, wise Translation: Men and women who believe, are guardians (and friends and helpers) of each other; They enjoin what is good and forbid what is bad; They perform the prayer; and they pay zakat; And they obey God and His Messenger; Soon God will grant them His mercy; God is Mighty, Wise! 3) Surah al-Ahzab, verse 35: Verily, the Muslims, the Muslims, the believers, the believers, the righteous, the righteous, the righteous, the patient, the patient, the humble, and the wicked. And those who are true, and those who are true, and those who fast, and those who fast, and those who keep them, and those who remember God much, and those who remember God, may they be forgiven. And the reward Translation: Surely, Muslim men and Muslim women, believing men and believing women, obedient men and obedient women, truthful men and truthful women, patient men and patient women, humble men and humble women, spending men and spending women, fasting men and fasting women, chaste men and chaste women, men who remember God much and women who remember God much - for all of them, God has prepared forgiveness and a great reward.

Statements in meetings with various groups of women -,1402/10,"/06 Title of the sheet: The lack of a role for gender in addressing community affairs Keyword(s): Woman, Woman in Islam, The Third Model of Woman Type(s): Hadith Text of the sheet: In addressing community affairs: Whoever wakes up and does not care about the affairs of Muslims is not a Muslim; (1) The fact that they said, “He is not a Muslim” means whether it is a woman or a man. When you wake up in the morning, whether you are a housewife, an employee, a working woman, an industrialist, whatever you do, you should think about the community; that is, be concerned about what the situation of the community is. . . This concern, concern, and being thoughtful is universal. Here too, gender does not play a role. Or the same “Whoever hears a man calling out, or for the Muslims”; (2) this lady who... spoke, said that our path is blocked in the cause of Palestine and in the cause of Gaza, otherwise we could have come. Now, for example, suppose this lady, who is a doctor, could have been there and treated the sick, the wounded, children and women. Everyone has a role, but the principle of this concern, the principle of this duty and sense of responsibility, is universal, it is not for men or women. 1) Al-Kafi, Thiqa al-Islam al-Kulaini, vol. 2, p. 163: “Whoever wakes up and does not care about the affairs of the Muslims is not a Muslim.” Translation: “Whoever wakes up and does not care about the affairs of the Muslims is not a Muslim.” 2) Al-Kafi, Thiqa al-Islam al-Kulaini, vol. 2, p. 164: “Whoever hears a man calling out for help and does not respond to him is not a Muslim.” Translation: “Whoever hears someone calling out for help and does not rush to help him is not a Muslim.” » Related to: Message to the National Congress of Seventeen Thousand Martyred, Freed and Veteran Women - 12/19/2020 Title of the Fact Sheet: Message to the National Congress of Seventeen Thousand Martyred, Freed and Veteran Women Keyword(s): Women&#39;s Role in the Islamic Revolution, Women&#39;s Presence on the Scene, Women&#39;s Role in Sacred Defense, Women Type(s): Quran Fact Sheet Text: In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful Martyrs, veterans and freed women represent one of the highest peaks of the honors of the Islamic Revolution and the Islamic Republic. The power of faith opened the way for great struggles for Iranian women and created amazing and unique scenes of their courageous, selfless and innovative presence in difficult fields. From the passionate demonstrations of the days of the revolution to the unforgettable period of the sacred defense, and from heroism in the ranks of battle to abandoning one&#39;s children and spouse and sending them to the front lines of danger and to service behind the front lines, and from being present on the front lines of science, research, technology and brilliance in the fields of literature and art, to performing in the social, political and managerial arenas, and finally, sacrifice in the field of health and serving patients in the recent dangerous test, all are signs of the spiritual elevation of Iranian women that has emerged thanks to the blessings of the Islamic system and the lessons and values of Islam. Undoubtedly, the martyred, veteran and free women - whose number has been estimated at seventeen thousand - are at the peak of these honors. Despite the culture of corruption and Western decadence imposed on many women during the unfortunate Pahlavi era, Iranian women were able to bring themselves closer to the desired honor and purity of Islam, and this is a great honor; and praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds. Seyyed Ali Khamenei March 8, 2020 1) Surah Al-Saffat, verse 182, and praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds! Translation: Praise and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds!
